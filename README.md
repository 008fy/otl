OTL
===

augmented clone of OTL (http://otl.sourceforge.net/) Oracle/SQL Server/DB2/... Database I/O Template Library


The git/github branches
-----------------------

- master: the main development branch. This one carries all the augmentation.

- sourceforge: this branch is tracking the original OTL website (http://otl.sourceforge.net/); the RCS capability at SF hasn't been used, and we haven't been able to dig up a complete revision chain for the original from the Internetz.
