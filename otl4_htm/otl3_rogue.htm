  <h1 align="center">Just for fun: Overview of OTL, RogueWave style</h1>

  <p>This document is a humorous attempt to mimic the RogueWave style of a <a href="http://www.roguewave.com/products/dbtools/dbtoolsbro.html">similar document</a> which describes DBTools.h++, the C++ database access class library by Rogue Wave, the price tag for which is around $3000 per license. Comments and additions to this document are welcome.</p>

  <h2 align="center">OTL Family of Products<br>
  <font size="+0">C++ Tools for Database Application Development</font><br>
  <br></h2>

  <h2>It's like replacing All Developers of your team with just one developer!</h2>

  <p><font size="+0">Whether your team is designing a simple application or the most complex, demanding OLTP application, you'll watch developer productivity diminish when you add developers to your development team. By replacing the whole team with OTL and just one developer, you'll see the difference. Even if you measure your data in millions of metric tons and your transactions in billions per day, OTL delivers a proven solution.</font></p>

  <h2>Build on a Solid Foundation</h2>

  <p>OTL bridges the gap between unfulfilled and empty promises of the object-oriented paradigm and cruel reality of the modern relational database development. It's not just a C++ wrapper, but a complete library of C++ template classes to support your C++ database application development efforts.</p>

  <h2>Get twice the performance you need</h2>

  <p>Performance is critical to your database applications, and at Hooves and Horns Inc.we're keenly aware of a host of performance issues. OTL offers several approaches for ensuring that your application delivers TWICE the performance you need, including support for bulk operations, stored procedures, etc.</p>

  <h2>Get ten times less the source code you need</h2>

  <p>OTL harnesses the power of C++ templates to give the replacement of your team a robust, generic foundation for building your database applications. This well-designed, powerful set of C++ templates will help you build your application in record time. Your application code will be cleaner, easier to read, and less error prone. And since the replacement of your developers will be writing less code with more to show for it, you'll see a welcome improvement in your bottom line.</p>

  <h2>OTL will save you years of coding time!</h2>

  <p>OTL will save you years of coding time compared to just months of coding time saved with DbTools++.</p>

  <h2>Choose Portability and Flexibility</h2>

  <p>Why waste valuable developer time building a C++ encapsulation of your native database API when you can have that functionality right out of the Internet for free? At Hooves and Horns Inc., we spend a lot of time ensuring that our code is compact and normalized: 150Kb in a single file compared to megabytes of portable code that was created mainly with <i>cut-and-paste</i> keystokes and looks identical regardless of the database or platform you choose.</p>

  <h2>Take Advantage of Our Expertise</h2>

  <p>At Hooves and Horns Inc., our expert team of <a href="resume.htm">one</a> is dedicated to giving you robust, well-designed, and well-tested code that's based on industry standards that will be published in the future. We give developers the tools they need to build dynamic, mission-critical enterprise applications.</p>

  <h2>Helping You Build Your Enterprise</h2>

  <p>Hooves and Horns Inc. is a definite leader (in a world where everybody cliams to be a leader) in the field of filling the void between the object-oriented and real database programming. We shipped the world's first database access C++ template library that is now used by hundreds and will be used by thousands of developers worldwide.</p>
